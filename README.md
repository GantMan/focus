focus (not yet functional)

####Quickly Remember and switch between recent projects.

*focus* is an app to maintain recent project directory paths with minimal effort.  (WHAT!?)

For those of us who work on a new project every week, you can keep your latest X projects in a focus group, 
and switch among them with this single command.

## Example

*Go to your directory of your latest project*

    $~: cd Projects/Client/resources/web/
    
*Use focus to set this directory*

    $~/Projects/Client/resources/web/: focus set
  
*Next time you load up a terminal, return with ease*

    $~: focus
    $~/Projects/Client/resources/web/:
